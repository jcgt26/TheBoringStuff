# Gmail Clorox
I have a problem, i have to much emails in my inbox.
A lot of them i wanna keep; a lot of them i would rather not. What if i classify them:
Let's say i bring Gemini into the mix, let it read the subject and the content.
1. Should the Email have a financial connotation -> lets keep it
2. Should it have something related to the german or colombian government -> keep it
3. Should it have anything related to citizenship or migration affairs -> keep it
4. Anything that looks like advertising -> dont wanna keep it.
5. Anything related to landlord and housing -> we wann keep it.


Label the unwanted things with a to-delete label (already existing in my gmail).
Lets have a gray zone. If Gemini thinks that the content might be sensible, and is worth a double check, then label it as double-check.

# The Program should have to Stages:
## Classification -> label emails
## Deleting -> delete unwanted emails
